# flutter_app

Flutter application for estimating and reporting demolition waste.

The app is in a very early stage as of writing this.

## Install Flutter

Once everything is correctly installed, running `flutter doctor` in terminal should return something like this:

```
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.27.3, on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS 6.8.0-52-generic, locale
    en_CA.UTF-8)
[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 33.0.0)
[✓] Chrome - develop for the web
[✓] Linux toolchain - develop for Linux desktop
[!] Android Studio (not installed)
[✓] VS Code (version 1.96.4)
[✓] Connected device (2 available)
[✓] Network resources

! Doctor found issues in 1 category.
```

Android Studio is not (yet) needed, so don't bother with it.

## Clone this repository

If you have access to this page, you can clone the repository. If git is not yet familiar, it is highly encouraged to spend some time on learning it.

Along with overall theory, the most important commands to study are:

```shell
git status
git checkout
git add
git commit
git push
git pull
```

Those commands will cover 90% what you ever do with git.

## Initial commit and its contents

Currently the repository holds a quickly made skeleton with basic input and output. Some comments are provided to explain basic things. A package called "maths" is provided locally to demonstrate how it's done.

All content of the initial commit can and should be modified eventually. Nothing is in its final state.

## Learn Flutter

Mess around with this repository, create your own Flutter playground, watch videos.
